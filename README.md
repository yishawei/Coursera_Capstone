The ultimate purpose of this project is to prevent avoidable car accidents by alerting drivers and relevant public functions with forecasted severity of car accidents. The estimation can be used as a good reference to remind people to be more careful in critical situations.

Some car accidents are caused by lacking of attention during driving, abusing drugs and alcohol or over-speed driving. Majority of these accidents can be prevented by setting harsher regulations and implementing properlly. However, there are also other uncontrollable factors like weather, visibility, road conditions significantly increase the probability of car accidents. Therefore revealing the underlying pattern in historical data and sending timely warnings to the drivers and public functions would be helpful in preventing avoidable car accidents and better allocating of rescue efforts.

The project should benefit individual drivers, local government, police, rescue groups, and car insurance institutes as well. The model and its results are going to provide some advice for these target audience to make insightful decisions for reducing the number of accidents and injuries.
